[Known Issues]
- Prices can have multiple currencies currently, but Shop is using US Dollars only (for example on Sorting by price.)
	In future, PaymentsAppSettings contains users currency, and shop can be managed with that currency.

# restful api
Tool is already setup and using those functions already.
But anyway, a little information about the API =>
This is a tiny service which has 5 different calls.
There is also an Insomnia (Restful Client) template so you can import it on Insomnia,
and use the API functions from there.
